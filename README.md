# Pewlett Hackard - Retirement Analysis
## Overview
This analysis was conducted to create 2 tables to analyze the number of retiring employees along with their position titles as well as determine the number of employees eligible for the mentorship program. The first table included the employee full name, employee number, position title as well as start/end dates. In the 2nd table, we have employee number, full name, birth date, start/end date and position title. Both queries were conducted using SQL in pgAdmin. The source query file for this analysis can be viewed ![here](https://github.com/JonathanBrown003/Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis/blob/b7fc65c07f9185199a9a84dbe578a194176ad630/Queries/Employee_Database_challenge.sql)

## Results
From the ![retiring_titles](https://github.com/JonathanBrown003/Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis/blob/6a250f36857c78b70e96704f29c52c6bf3f46beb/Data/retiring_titles.csv) csv file, we can clearly ascertain that 2/3 of likely upcoming retirements will be Senior Engineers or Senior Staff. We should have our recruiting department start to bring in replacements soon for training and to soak up as much institutional knowledge as they can from these senior staff close to retirement. 

We can also have leadership view the ![mentorship_eligibility](https://github.com/JonathanBrown003/Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis/blob/b7fc65c07f9185199a9a84dbe578a194176ad630/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv) candidates in this file to review and decide which employees will be eligible to be a mentor going forward. We can pair these employees with new or mid-career staff for training and understanding of company culture, strategy and operations. This will ensure smooth operations moving forward as the "silver tsunami" sweeps Pewlett Hackard with retirements.
