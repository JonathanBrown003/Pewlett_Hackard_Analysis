# Pewlett Hackard - Retirement Analysis
## Overview
This analysis was conducted to create 2 tables to analyze the number of retiring employees along with their position titles as well as determine the number of employees eligible for the mentorship program. The first table included the employee full name, employee number, position title as well as start/end dates. In the 2nd table, we have employee number, full name, birth date, start/end date and position title. Both queries were conducted using SQL in pgAdmin. 

## Results
From the ![retiring_titles](https://github.com/JonathanBrown003/Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis/blob/6a250f36857c78b70e96704f29c52c6bf3f46beb/Data/retiring_titles.csv) csv file, we can clearly ascertain that 2/3 of likely upcoming retirements will be Senior Engineers or Senior Staff. We should have our recruiting department start to bring in replacements soon for training and to soak up as much institutional knowledge as they can from these senior staff close to retirement.
